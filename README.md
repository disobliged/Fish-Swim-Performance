***

Analyses conducted in R to research how the hindgut microbiome affects fish swim speed. This project was made for MICB 305 and has been published on \[UJEMI].

## Research Question
> Does hindgut microbial diversity, core microbiota, differentially abundant taxa and predicted energy metabolic pathways correlate with swimming performance across fish species?

### Mentors
We received generous support from [Avril Metcalfe-Roach](https://github.com/armetcal) and [Imogen Porter](https://github.com/iporter-16) in the creation of our project. We thank them for their support during the term.

## Agenda Formatting
Both agendas and meeting minutes are consolidated into the same file for efficiency and tidiness.

- ```agendas``` is where our meeting agendas/minutes live.
- ```datasets``` is where we stored the datasets we used and RDS files we made.
- ```picrust_output``` and ```picrust_strat_output``` is where the PICRUSt2 unstratified and stratified outputs are saved respectively.
- ```plots``` is where our generated plots are saved.
- ```scripts``` is where we made our scripts.
- The ```archive``` and ```archivedScripts``` folders are where we saved unused plots and scripts respectively

## Open Source
The project's dataset is open access and can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34557-2).
In an effort to keep research accessible, the project's code is licensed under the GPL v3 license. This is done so the code will always be free and accessible for future reference.
